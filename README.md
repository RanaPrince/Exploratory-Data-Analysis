Problems Explored and tackled:
- High level statistics of the dataset: number of points, numer of features, number of classes, data-points per class.
- Perform Univaraite analysis(PDF, CDF, Boxplot, Voilin plots) to understand which features are useful towards classification.
- Perform Bi-variate analysis (scatter plots, pair-plots) to see if combinations of features are useful in classfication.
- Write your observations in english as crisply and unambigously as possible. Always quantify your results.


Conclusion of the Data Analysis can be found on the Notebook itself. Readable Jupyter Notebook present.
